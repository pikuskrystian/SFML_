Snake 2D on LINUX
How to play: Press enter in the main menu to start the game. In-game, use WASD or the arrow keys to change directions, and press Escape to exit the game.

The snake (green) always goes forward. Eat fruits (the red balls) to gain points. After eating, the snake grows, and every three fruits it eats, it accelerates. If the snake bites itself, you lose one life and start over, but you keep the points you earned. When you lose your three lives, everything including your points gets reset.
